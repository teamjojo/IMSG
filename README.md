# IMSG
this is the email system for The NutBox             
we use it like this
the arduino sends the temprature, power and smoke levels to the mac mini
the mac mini says he the temprature is high and we have a lot of smoke trigger error codes 
those trigger IMSG/Brakes(all power off)
the arduino does the brakes and keeps sending all its info to the server
everybody gets emails saying the error code/why/info/and backup power(for the arduino) levels
thats how it works
